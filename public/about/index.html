    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Reinforcement learning is an elegant and simple problem definition for autonomous decision-making agents that learn
from their own experience. It elegantly subsumes questions of perception, prediction, planning, memory, etc &ndash; all the relevant
subfields of AI. But the methods to solve this simple problem definition are not so simple, filled with important
mathematical details and consistenting of many moving parts. The area is much more difficult to learn than supervised
learning and other subfields of AI. It took me quite sometime, even past my PhD program, to feel comfortable with it
and even today there is still much more for me to learn.</p>
<p>Because of its difficulty, I&rsquo;ve answered many different questions about the field over the years. But my answers to these
questions are dispersed across many different social media sites such as Quora and conversations on Discord servers.
That makes it difficult to find these answers and the mediums are not always the best fit for communicating the ideas.</p>
<p>To remedy that problem, I have created this website. It is called &ldquo;Decisions &amp; Dragons.&rdquo; &ldquo;Decisions&rdquo; because reinforcement
learning is ultiamtely about learning to make good decisions. &ldquo;Dragons&rdquo; because there are many dragons to avoid (or fight)
in your efforts to solve the problem. The astute reader may have noticed that this title is similar to the famous
pen-and-paper role playing game &ldquo;Dungeons &amp; Dragons,&rdquo; but this similarity is purely conincidental and certainly not
because I&rsquo;m a nerd who sometimes plays Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p>I will iniitally populate this site with some of the more popular
answers I&rsquo;ve given to common questions in the past, although I may slightly adapt the answer and question from
the original source to make it more accessible. Going forward, when I answer a question that I think is
sufficiently general, I will work to clean it up and add it to this site.</p>
<p>On an occassion, I may also use this site to post opinion pieces on RL or AI more broadly.
But I&rsquo;m not sure yet. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m James MacGlashan. If you want to talk to me (or ask me RL questions), the best place is either on <a href="https://twitter.com/jmac_ai">Twitter</a>, or
on the <a href="https://discord.gg/rn7J7W4F">Reinforcement Learning Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>I received my PhD in computer science from the University of Maryland, Balitmore County in 2013 where I
worked on reinforcement learning. I then moved on to do a postdoc at Brown University, continuing to work on reinforcement learning.
Following my postdoc, I joined the startup Cogitai, where we worked to build reinforcement learning and
continual learning as a service. Cogitai was eventually acquired by Sony to form the game AI team at Sony AI, where I
currently reside and continue to work on reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Despite all these years working on reinforcement learning, I have surprisingly failed to solve it. But I will continue to work
on it until I do or until I run out of time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it hasn&rsquo;t all been bad news. The community has made numerous advancements,
and I&rsquo;ve played a role in bringining reinforcement learning to production with
<a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gran-turismo-sophy/">GT Sophy</a> &ndash; an RL agent that outraced the best racers in the game Gran Turismo Sport and which was subsequent adapted to be a racing opponent in Gran Turismo 7.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to work on exciting reinforcement learning applications and problems at Sony AI and I hope we can help
turn reinforcement learning into a robust technology that can be broadly used by more people. Perhaps one that is less
fraught with dragons.</p>
