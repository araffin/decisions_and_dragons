    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is an elegant and simple problem definition for autonomous decision-making agents that learn
from their own experience. It subsumes questions of perception, prediction, planning, memory, etc &ndash; all the relevant
subfields of AI. But the methods to solve this simple problem definition are not so simple. Unlike supervised learning, which typically involves training a single model, RL methods often involve training multiple interacting models. These interactions can lead to complex and unexpected mathematical challenges. As a result, a significant portion of RL research focuses on addressing these intricate complications.</p>
<p>Due to these complexities, I struggled grasp RL for a significant amount of time. Despite understanding the general concepts, I lacked a solid foundation to develop the intuition necessary for effectively applying methods and innovating new ideas. I often felt like I was missing a crucial piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>I overcame my struggles with reinforcement learning by rigorously building my understanding from fundamental principles. To assist others in avoiding similar obstacles, I created this Q&amp;A site. I&rsquo;ve carefully selected questions that expose common misconceptions about the core mechanics and provide answers that follow a structured approach. Each answer begins with a concise and correct response, followed by a step-by-step derivation from first principles.</p>
<p>My goal is to help you rapidly develop your intuition and master the subject. By working through these answers, you&rsquo;ll gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, how they fit together, and be better equipped to apply reinforcement learning methods effectively.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-name">About the name</h2>
<p>This site is called &ldquo;Decisions &amp; Dragons,&rdquo; a name that reflects the focus of reinforcement learning (RL). &ldquo;Decisions&rdquo; represents the core goal of RL: developing agents that learn to make effective decisions. &ldquo;Dragons&rdquo; symbolizes the intricate complexities and challenges that must be skillfully navigated in pursuit of solving the problem.</p>
<p>The astute reader may have observed the striking resemblence between this title and the famous
pen-and-paper role playing game &ldquo;Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&rdquo; I assure you, this similarity is purely conincidental and certainly not
because I&rsquo;m trying to piggyback on the popularity of a game I enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-will-update-the-site">How I will update the site</h2>
<p>This site has been initially populated with answers to frequently asked questions that I&rsquo;ve encountered and addressed in the past. While I may have adapted my responses from their original form on other social media platforms, the core insights remain the same.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I will continue to curate and share my responses to new and emerging questions, as well as revisit and refine my previous answers as needed.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I may also use this platform to share opinion pieces on RL and AI more broadly, although I am less sure of this direction. This site is still a work in progress and I&rsquo;ll evolve it based on feedback and interest.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m James MacGlashan. If you want to talk to me (or ask me RL questions), the best place is either on <a href="https://twitter.com/jmac_ai">Twitter</a>, or
on the <a href="https://discord.gg/rn7J7W4F">Reinforcement Learning Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>I received my PhD in computer science from the University of Maryland, Balitmore County in 2013 where I
worked on reinforcement learning. I then moved on to do a postdoc at Brown University, where I continued to work on reinforcement learning.
Following my postdoc, I joined the startup Cogitai, where we worked to build reinforcement learning and
continual learning as a service. Cogitai was eventually acquired by Sony to form the game AI team at <a href="https://ai.sony/">Sony AI</a>, where I
currently reside and continue to work on reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Despite all these years working on reinforcement learning, I have surprisingly failed to solve it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it hasn&rsquo;t all been bad news. RL methods have vastly improved
and I&rsquo;ve played a role in bringining reinforcement learning to production with
<a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gran-turismo-sophy/">GT Sophy</a> &ndash; an RL agent that outraced the best racers in the game Gran Turismo Sport. GT Sophy was subsequently adapted to be a racing opponent in Gran Turismo 7 that you can play against today!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to work on exciting reinforcement learning applications and problems at Sony AI and I hope we can help
turn reinforcement learning into a robust technology that can be more broadly used. Perhaps one that is less
fraught with dragons.</p>
