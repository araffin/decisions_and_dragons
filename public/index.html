    <p>This site gathers my responses to reinforcement learning questions from various social media platforms and interactions.</p>
<p>Each answer begins with a concise explanation, accessible to those with relevant background knowledge. Of course, if you&rsquo;re here, you may not have <em>all</em> of the relevant background knowledge. This site is primarily written for those of you who do not. Following the concise explanation, I derive the answer from first principles, explaining each of the ideas.</p>
<p>Below you will the most recently published questions and answers. You can find the complete list of all questions and answers in the <a href="/posts/">posts section</a>. You can learn more about
me and why I created this site in the <a href="/about/">about section</a>.</p>

      <h3><a class="post_link" href="/posts/off_policy_replay/">Why does experience replay require off-policy learning and how is it different from on-policy learning?</a></h3>
      <p>When you use an experience replay buffer, you save the most recent $k$ experiences of the agent, and sample data from that buffer for training. Typically, the agent does a step of training to update its policy for every step in the environment. For any moment in time the vast majority of experiences in the buffer are generated with a different &ndash; earlier &ndash; policy than the current policy. And if the policy used to collect data is different than the policy being evaluated or improved, then you need an off-policy method.</p> <a href="/posts/off_policy_replay/">[See more]</a>
    
      <h3><a class="post_link" href="/posts/horizon/">What is the &#34;horizon&#34; in reinforcement learning?</a></h3>
      <p>In reinforcement learning, an agent receives reward on each time step and the goal, loosely speaking, is to maximize the future reward received. But that doesn’t actually fully define the goal, because each decision can affect what the agent can do in the future. Consequently, we’re left with the question &ldquo;how does potential future reward affect our decision right now?&rdquo; The &ldquo;horizon&rdquo; in RL refers to how far into the future the agent cares about reward. You can have finite-horizon objectives, or even infinite-horizon objectives.</p> <a href="/posts/horizon/">[See more]</a>
    
      <h3><a class="post_link" href="/posts/q_learning_discrete_only/">Why doesn&#39;t Q-learning work with continuous actions?</a></h3>
      <p>Q-learning requires finding the action with the maximum Q-value in two places: (1) In the learning update itself; and (2) when extracting the policy from the learned Q-values. When there are a small number of discrete actions, you can simply enumerate the Q-values for each and pick the action with the highest value. However, this approach does not work with continuous actions, because there are an infinite number of actions to evaluate!</p> <a href="/posts/q_learning_discrete_only/">[See more]</a>
