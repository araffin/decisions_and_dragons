Reinforcement learning is an elegant and simple problem definition for autonomous decision-making agents that learn
from their own experience. It subsumes questions of perception, prediction, planning, memory, etc -- all the relevant
subfields of AI. But the methods to solve this simple problem are not so simple. The algorithm deriviations require understanding many important mathematical details and the methods in practice have many moving parts. The area is much more difficult to learn than supervised
learning and other subfields of AI. It took me quite sometime, even past my PhD program, to feel comfortable with it
and even today there is still much more to learn.

Because of its difficulty, I've tried to help by answering common questions people have. Especially when
the questions concern topics that I struggled to learn myself. 
Until now, my answers to these questions were dispersed across many different social media sites such as Quora and conversations on 
Discord servers. That makes it difficult to find these answers and the mediums are not always the best fit for communicating the ideas.

To remedy that problem, I have created this website. It is called "Decisions & Dragons." "Decisions" because reinforcement
learning is ultiamtely about learning to make good decisions. "Dragons" because there are many dragons to avoid 
in your efforts to solve the problem. 

The astute reader may have noticed that this title is similar to the famous
pen-and-paper role playing game "Dungeons & Dragons," but this similarity is purely conincidental and certainly not
because I'm a nerd who sometimes plays Dungeons & Dragons.

I will iniitally populate this site with some of the more popular
answers I've given to common questions in the past, although I may slightly adapt the answer and question from
the original source. Going forward, I will do my best to move new questions I've answered to this site more quickly.

On an occassion, I may also use this site to post opinion pieces on RL or AI more broadly. 
But I'm not sure yet. We'll see how it goes.

## About me
I'm James MacGlashan. If you want to talk to me (or ask me RL questions), the best place is either on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmac_ai), or 
on the [Reinforcement Learning Discord server](https://discord.gg/rn7J7W4F).

I received my PhD in computer science from the University of Maryland, Balitmore County in 2013 where I 
worked on reinforcement learning. I then moved on to do a postdoc at Brown University, continuing to work on reinforcement learning.
Following my postdoc, I joined the startup Cogitai, where we worked to build reinforcement learning and 
continual learning as a service. Cogitai was eventually acquired by Sony to form the game AI team at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/), where I 
currently reside and continue to work on reinforcement learning.

Despite all these years working on reinforcement learning, I have surprisingly failed to solve it.

Fortunately, it hasn't all been bad news. The community has made numerous advancements,
and I've played a role in bringining reinforcement learning to production with 
[GT Sophy](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gran-turismo-sophy/) -- an RL agent that outraced the best racers in the game Gran Turismo Sport and which was subsequently adapted to be a racing opponent in Gran Turismo 7 that you can play against today!

We're continuing to work on exciting reinforcement learning applications and problems at Sony AI and I hope we can help
turn reinforcement learning into a robust technology that can be more broadly used. Perhaps one that is less
fraught with dragons.
