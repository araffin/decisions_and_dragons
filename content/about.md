Reinforcement learning (RL) is an elegant problem definition for autonomous decision-making agents that learn
from their own experience. It subsumes questions of perception, prediction, planning, memory, etc -- all the relevant
subfields of AI. But the methods to solve this simple problem definition are not so simple. Unlike supervised learning, which typically involves training a single model, RL methods often involve training multiple interacting models. These interactions can lead to complex and unexpected mathematical challenges. As a result, a significant portion of RL research focuses on addressing these intricate complications.

Due to these complexities, I struggled grasp RL for a significant amount of time. Despite understanding the general concepts, I lacked a solid foundation to develop the intuition necessary for effectively applying methods and innovating new ideas. I often felt like I was missing a crucial piece of the puzzle.

I overcame my struggles with reinforcement learning by rigorously building my understanding from fundamental principles. To assist others in overcoming similar obstacles, I created this Q&A site. I've carefully selected questions that expose common misconceptions about the core mechanics for RL and provide answers that follow a structured approach. Each answer begins with a concise and correct response, followed by a step-by-step derivation from first principles.

My goal is to help you rapidly develop your intuition and master the subject. By working through these answers, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, how they fit together, and be better equipped to apply reinforcement learning methods effectively.

That's the hope at least. The dirty secret is most of us have to suffer to gain competence. Remember that the next time you feel imposter syndrom. But with luck, perhaps this site will help you minimize the time that you must suffer.

## About the name

This site is called "Decisions & Dragons," a name that reflects the focus on reinforcement learning (RL). "Decisions" represents the core goal of RL: developing agents that learn to make effective decisions. "Dragons" represents the perilous complexities and challenges that must be suffered and navigated in pursuit of solving the problem.

The astute reader may have observed the striking resemblence between this title and the famous
pen-and-paper role playing game "Dungeons & Dragons." I assure you, this similarity is purely conincidental and certainly not
because I'm trying to piggyback on the popularity of a game I enjoy.

## How I will update the site

At the time of launch, I populated this site with answers to frequently asked questions that I've encountered and addressed in the past. While I may have adapted my responses from their original form on other social media platforms, the core insights remain the same.

Moving forward, I will continue to curate and share my responses to new and emerging questions, as well as revisit and refine my previous answers as needed.

Occasionally, I may also use this platform to share opinion pieces on RL and AI more broadly, although I am less sure of this direction. This site is still a work in progress and I'll evolve it based on feedback and interest.

## About me

I'm James MacGlashan. If you want to ask me RL questions, the best place is either on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmac_ai), or
on the [Reinforcement Learning Discord server](https://discord.gg/rn7J7W4F).

I received my PhD in computer science from the University of Maryland, Balitmore County in 2013 where I
worked on reinforcement learning. I then moved on to a postdoctoral position at Brown University, where I continued to work on reinforcement learning.
Following my postdoc, I joined the startup Cogitai, where we worked to build reinforcement learning and
continual learning as a service. Cogitai was eventually acquired by Sony to form the game AI team at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/), where I
continue to work on reinforcement learning.

Despite all these years working on reinforcement learning, I have shockingly failed to solve it.

Fortunately, it hasn't all been bad news for the field. RL methods have vastly improved
and I've played a role in bringining reinforcement learning to products with
[GT Sophy](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gran-turismo-sophy/) -- an RL agent that outraced the best racers in the game Gran Turismo Sport. GT Sophy was subsequently adapted to be a racing opponent in Gran Turismo 7 that you can race against today!

We're continuing to work on exciting reinforcement learning applications and problems at Sony AI and I hope we can help
turn reinforcement learning into a robust technology that can be more broadly used. Perhaps one that is less
fraught with dragons.
