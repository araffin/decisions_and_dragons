I have a tendency to make a lot of typos. My brain reads what I meant, not what I typed. On an occasion, I may also make an error (:gasp:) or state something too imprecisely. 

I don't have collaborators for this site to check for any kind of errors. Therefore, if you spot an error of any sort, please let me know by reporting it on my [Github issues page](https://github.com/jmacglashan/decisions_and_dragons/issues).

Below I will list corrections others have pointed out. As of now, there are no user-submitted corrections because the site is too new, too unpopular, or because I've been uncharacteristically error-free. Feel free to remedy that!
