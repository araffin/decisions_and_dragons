This site gathers my responses to reinforcement learning questions from various social media platforms and interactions.

Each answer begins with a concise explanation, accessible to those with relevant background knowledge. Of course, if you're here, you may not have _all_ of the relevant background knowledge. This site is primarily written for those of you who do not. Following the concise explanation, I derive the answer from first principles, explaining each of the ideas.

Below you will the most recently published questions and answers. You can find the complete list of all questions and answers in the [posts section](/posts/). You can learn more about
me and why I created this site in the [about section](/about/).
