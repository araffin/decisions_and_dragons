This site is a collection of various answers I've given to question about
reinforcement learning over the years from various social media sites. 
It also includes an occasional unsolicited elaboration
on a topic and opinion pieces of the state of AI in general. 

You can learn more about
me and why I created this site in the [about section](/about/). You can find
a list of all posts in the [posts section](/posts/).
