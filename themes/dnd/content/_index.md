This site is a collection of answers to question about
reinforcement learning that I've given over the years on various social media sites.
It also includes occasional opinion pieces of AI in general.

All my answers start with a short answer that should be understandable to someone with sufficient background knowledge. However, in my experience, short answers can only point you in the right direction. To become facile with good intutions, I always had to derive the answers from first principles. Therefore, immediately following each short answer, I derive the answer instead of merely giving the answer. If things go well, the short answer should make much more sense after reading the derivation.
