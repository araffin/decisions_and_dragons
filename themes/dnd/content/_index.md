This site gathers my responses to reinforcement learning questions from various social media platforms, along with occasional AI-related opinion pieces.

Each answer begins with a concise explanation, accessible to those with relevant background knowledge. However, if you're here, you may not have _all_ of the relevant background knowledge. Therefore, following each short answer, I derive the answer from first principles. By the end of the derivation, you shoud find the initial short answer much more understandable.

You can learn more about
me and why I created this site in the [about section](/about/). You can find a comprehensive list of all posts in the [posts section](/posts/).
